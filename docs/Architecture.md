# AI Novel Project Architecture

## Overview

This project facilitates the generation of long-form novels through a multi-agent collaborative system (Multi-Agent System), leveraging a structured memory approach to ensure narrative consistency and logical integrity over extended contexts.

## Core Concepts

### 0. Unified Discussion Logging

Discussion artifacts for `world`, `plot`, `guide`, and `chapter_text` now follow one schema and title convention:

* Title: `[phase_type] chapter={n|NA} round={r|NA} role={role}`
* Fields: `log_id`, `timestamp`, `phase_type`, `chapter_num`, `round`, `role`, `model`, `input_summary`, `output_summary`, `decision`, `needs_revision`, `artifact_paths`
* Index: every entry is also appended to `process/discussions/discussion_index.jsonl`

### 1. Three-Tier Fact System

To maintain continuity, narrative facts are categorized into three levels of "hardness," managed by a hybrid database system (SQLite + FAISS).

#### Tier 1: Core Constraints (Structural)

* **Definition:** Immutable or highly resistant facts that define the world and characters.
* **Storage:** SQLite (`characters`, `relationships`, `world_rules` tables).
* **Enforcement:** Strict filtering. The Writer Agent is explicitly forbidden from contradicting these.
* **Updates:** Supports character trait evolution and status updates.

#### Tier 2: Major Milestones (Semi-Structural)

* **Definition:** Significant events that alter the state of the world or characters.
* **Storage:** SQLite (`timeline` table).
* **Features:** Tracks `related_entities` and `location` for targeted retrieval.
* **Enforcement:** Retrieved based on timeline context to ensure cause-and-effect consistency.

#### Tier 3: Narrative Details (Atmospheric)

* **Definition:** Ephemeral or granular details that provide color but don't break the plot if slightly altered (though consistency is preferred).
* **Storage:** FAISS Vector Index + SQLite Metadata (`vector_metadata` table).
* **Enforcement:** Semantic Retrieval with optional Metadata Filtering (e.g., "visuals" at "Tavern").

## Data Schema

### Schema Versioning

* SQLite schema upgrades are now forward-only migrations managed by `MemoryManager`.
* Version state is stored in `schema_meta` (`key='schema_version'`).
* Databases without `schema_meta` are treated as unsupported legacy state and must be re-initialized.
* Fact tables include audit metadata fields: `source_commit_id`, `version`, `is_deleted`, `intent_tag`.

### SQLite Tables

## Agent Workflow (Closed Loop)

The system operates on a continuous Plan-Write-Scan loop where the output of one chapter directly updates the context for the next.

0. **Pre-Planning Stage (Plot Construction)**
   * **Input:** Approved World Bible.
   * **Action:** Planner produces a high-level plot outline, then a detailed plot outline.
   * **Discussion:** Critic reviews each outline; Planner revises for bounded rounds.
   * **Output:** `frame/plot/plot_outline.md` + `frame/plot/detailed_plot_outline.md` and discussion logs.

1. **Planner Agent (Narrative Planner)**
   * **Input:**
     * Static: World Bible + Plot Outline + Detailed Plot Outline.
     * **Dynamic (New):** Queries the Memory Database for "Active Characters" (Status, Traits) and "Recent History" (Last 5 Timeline Events).
     * **Semantic Context (New):** Uses intent-gated vector retrieval to inject relevant Tier-3 details from FAISS.
     * Context: Previous Chapter Summary.
   * **Output:** A structured "Writing Contract" (Chapter Outline).
   * **Discussion Gate (New):**
     * Critic reviews each chapter guide.
     * Planner revises for bounded rounds before Writer starts.

2. **Writer Agent (Novelist)**
   * **Input:** The Writing Contract.
   * **Action:** Generates the prose, focusing on "Show, Don't Tell" and strictly following the scene breakdown.
   * **Output:** Markdown-formatted Chapter Text.

3. **Critic Agent (Chapter Review)**
   * **Input:** Writing Contract + generated Chapter Text.
   * **Action:** Produces contradiction scan + patch guidance.
   * **Output:** Structured review text (`NEEDS_REVISION`, rationale, patch guidance).
   * **Discussion Artifact (New):** Chapter-level text discussion is persisted under `process/discussions/chapter_{n}_text_discussion.md`.

4. **Scanner Agent (Archivist)**
   * **Input:** The generated Chapter Text.
   * **Action:** Analyzes the text to extract new facts.
   * **Output:** **Structured JSON** containing:
     * `new_characters` / `updated_characters`
     * `new_rules` (World building updates)
     * `relationships` (Character dynamics)
     * `events` (Timeline additions)
     * `details` (Semantic chunks for Vector Store)
   * **Validation Gate (New):**
     * Payload must pass schema checks before DB mutation.
     * Invalid payloads are persisted for debugging and rejected from commit.

5. **Memory Manager (System)**
   * **Action:** Parses the Scanner's JSON.
   * **Updates:**
     * **SQLite:** Inserts/Updates rows in `characters` and `timeline`.
     * **FAISS:** Embeds semantic details and adds them to the vector index.
   * **Audit Layer (New):**
     * Writes row-level revisions into `fact_revisions`.
     * Records chapter batch state in `chapter_commits`.
     * Queues unresolved hard contradictions in `conflict_queue`.

6. **Loop**
   * The next Planner iteration queries the updated database, ensuring the story reacts to previous events (e.g., if a character died in Chapter 1, the Planner for Chapter 2 knows they are dead).
   * Chapter summaries are persisted in `chapter_{n}_facts_summary.md` and reused when resuming auto mode from later chapters.
   * Auto mode is interruption-resumable by artifact detection:
     * Runtime artifacts under `novel/` are validated before resume (`.json`, `.jsonl`, markdown/text files, and chapter commit linkage).
     * `chapter_{n}_facts.json` must remain valid JSON and pass schema checks.
     * `discussion_index.jsonl` is line-validated as JSONL.
     * A chapter is considered complete only when chapter text, facts summary, facts JSON, and latest `scan_chapter` commit payload/status are all valid.
     * If any check fails, chapter-scoped artifacts are discarded and the chapter is regenerated from planning.

## Conflict Visibility in Planning

Planner context now includes a compact list of pending conflicts (`conflict_queue`) so generated contracts can avoid compounding unresolved contradictions.

## Retrieval Pipeline (Intent -> SQLite -> FAISS -> Alignment)

Planning/writing retrieval now follows an explicit chain:

1. Query intent classification (`task_type`, strictness, required tiers, semantic gate).
2. SQLite prefilter (characters/rules/events/conflicts by intent scope).
3. FAISS semantic retrieval (Tier-3 candidates).
4. Cross-tier alignment (drop/penalize semantic hits conflicting with hard facts, e.g., dead-character active details under strict mode).
5. Context package assembly for prompts (policy + compact summaries + aligned Tier-3 details).

## Conflict Resolution Path

Pending conflicts are manually resolvable through CLI actions (`keep_existing` / `apply_incoming` for supported types), and resolution state is stored back in `conflict_queue` with notes and timestamps.

## Conflict Levels (Blocking vs Non-Blocking)

* `conflict_queue` now stores `blocking_level` (`BLOCKING` or `NON_BLOCKING`).
* `conflict_queue` also stores triage metadata: `priority` and `suggested_action`.
* Workflow gating behavior is controlled by `BLOCKING_CONFLICT_MODE`:
  * `auto_keep_existing`: auto-resolve `BLOCKING` conflicts with `keep_existing` before gate checks.
  * `manual_block`: never auto-resolve; gate blocks while any `BLOCKING` conflict remains.
* Example:
  * `timeline_dead_character_involved` -> `BLOCKING`
  * `relationship_type_change` -> `NON_BLOCKING`

## Commit Replay Recovery

* `chapter_commits` now tracks `error_message`, `replay_count`, and `last_replayed_at`.
* Failed scan commits can be replayed from persisted `payload_json` through CLI (`--replay-commit`).
* Replay runs the same DB mutation path (`apply_fact_payload`) under a fresh transaction and promotes commit status back to `COMPLETED` on success.
* FAISS can be deterministically rebuilt from `vector_metadata` (`--rebuild-vectors`) to recover DB/vector alignment.

## Initialization Seeding

After World Bible + Plot discussions finish, the system asks the Scanner role to extract initial structured facts (JSON schema identical to chapter scanning) and seeds SQLite/FAISS before Chapter 1 planning. This reduces empty-context starts and improves early chapter continuity.

## System Robustness & Integrity

The system employs several layers of engineering to maintain stability and consistency during long-form generation.

### 1. Multi-tier Retrieval Funnel

To avoid "context pollution," the `StoryStateManager` filters and ranks facts:

* **Intent-based Gating**: Determines if semantic retrieval is needed.
* **SQLite Pre-filtering**: Limits character and event scope based on focus entities.
* **Cross-Tier Alignment**: Filters out semantic hallucinations (T3) that contradict hard facts (T1/T2), such as a dead character performing actions.
* **Weighted Reranking**: Boosts details that match focus entities (+0.35) or locations (+0.50).

### 2. Atomic Memory Transactions

`MemoryManager` ensures that a single bad scan doesn't corrupt the long-term memory:

* **FAISS Index Cloning**: At the start of a chapter commit, the system creates a full snapshot of the vector index.
* **Synchronized Rollback**: If a `BLOCKING` conflict occurs, the system rollbacks the SQLite transaction and restores the FAISS index from the snapshot.

### 3. Exhaustive Interruption Recovery

The `WorkflowResumeMixin` performs a three-stage integrity check during resume:

1. **Physical**: Validates file existence and non-zero size.
2. **Schema**: Validates JSON/JSONL against required schemas.
3. **Database**: Validates that the chapter commit status is marked as `COMPLETED` in the SQLite `chapter_commits` table.
*Any failure triggers a clean purge of all partial chapter artifacts.*

### 4. Language Guard

Ensures output consistency by calculating a CJK/Latin confidence ratio. If the output language is incorrect, the system triggers an automatic LLM-driven rewrite loop.

## Customization

### i18n & Prompts

All system prompts and user-facing strings are managed in the `i18n/` directory:

* **AI Fragments & Templates**: `i18n/AI/{language_code}/`
  * `fragments.json`: Short instructions and labels used in Context.
  * `templates.md`: Multi-line system prompts and task instructions (organized by `## Key`).
* **User Messages**: `i18n/messages/{language_code}/ui.json` (UI strings, summaries, and reports).

You can add new languages or modify behavior by creating/editing files in these directories and updating `config.LANGUAGE`.
