# AI Novel Project Architecture

## Overview

This project facilitates the generation of long-form novels through a multi-agent collaborative system (Multi-Agent System), leveraging a structured memory approach to ensure narrative consistency and logical integrity over extended contexts.

## Core Concepts

### 0. Unified Discussion Logging

Discussion artifacts for `world`, `plot`, `guide`, and `chapter_text` now follow one schema and title convention:

* Title: `[phase_type] chapter={n|NA} round={r|NA} role={role}`
* Fields: `log_id`, `timestamp`, `phase_type`, `chapter_num`, `round`, `role`, `model`, `input_summary`, `output_summary`, `decision`, `needs_revision`, `artifact_paths`
* Index: every entry is also appended to `process/discussions/discussion_index.jsonl`

### 1. Three-Tier Fact System

To maintain continuity, narrative facts are categorized into three levels of "hardness," managed by a hybrid database system (SQLite + FAISS).

#### Tier 1: Core Constraints (Structural)

* **Definition:** Immutable or highly resistant facts that define the world and characters.
* **Storage:** SQLite (`characters`, `relationships`, `world_rules` tables).
* **Enforcement:** Strict filtering. The Writer Agent is explicitly forbidden from contradicting these.
* **Updates:** Supports character trait evolution and status updates.

#### Tier 2: Major Milestones (Semi-Structural)

* **Definition:** Significant events that alter the state of the world or characters.
* **Storage:** SQLite (`timeline` table).
* **Features:** Tracks `related_entities` and `location` for targeted retrieval.
* **Enforcement:** Retrieved based on timeline context to ensure cause-and-effect consistency.

#### Tier 3: Narrative Details (Atmospheric)

* **Definition:** Ephemeral or granular details that provide color but don't break the plot if slightly altered (though consistency is preferred).
* **Storage:** FAISS Vector Index + SQLite Metadata (`vector_metadata` table).
* **Enforcement:** Semantic Retrieval with optional Metadata Filtering (e.g., "visuals" at "Tavern").

## Data Schema

### Schema Versioning

* SQLite schema upgrades are now forward-only migrations managed by `MemoryManager`.
* Version state is stored in `schema_meta` (`key='schema_version'`).
* Databases without `schema_meta` are treated as unsupported legacy state and must be re-initialized.
* Fact tables include audit metadata fields: `source_commit_id`, `version`, `is_deleted`, `intent_tag`.

### SQLite Tables

## Agent Workflow (Closed Loop)

The system operates on a continuous Plan-Write-Scan loop where the output of one chapter directly updates the context for the next.

0. **Pre-Planning Stage (Plot Construction)**
   * **Input:** Approved World Bible.
   * **Action:** Planner produces a high-level plot outline, then a detailed plot outline.
   * **Discussion:** Critic reviews each outline; Planner revises for bounded rounds.
   * **Output:** `frame/plot/plot_outline.md` + `frame/plot/detailed_plot_outline.md` and discussion logs.

1. **Planner Agent (Narrative Planner)**
   * **Input:**
     * Static: World Bible + Plot Outline + Detailed Plot Outline.
     * **Dynamic (New):** Queries the Memory Database for "Active Characters" (Status, Traits) and "Recent History" (Last 5 Timeline Events).
     * **Semantic Context (New):** Uses intent-gated vector retrieval to inject relevant Tier-3 details from FAISS.
     * Context: Previous Chapter Summary.
   * **Output:** A structured "Writing Contract" (Chapter Outline).
   * **Discussion Gate (New):**
     * Critic reviews each chapter guide.
     * Planner revises for bounded rounds before Writer starts.

2. **Writer Agent (Novelist)**
   * **Input:** The Writing Contract.
   * **Action:** Generates the prose, focusing on "Show, Don't Tell" and strictly following the scene breakdown.
   * **Output:** Markdown-formatted Chapter Text.

3. **Critic Agent (Chapter Review)**
   * **Input:** Writing Contract + generated Chapter Text.
   * **Action:** Produces contradiction scan + patch guidance.
   * **Output:** Structured review text (`NEEDS_REVISION`, rationale, patch guidance).
   * **Discussion Artifact (New):** Chapter-level text discussion is persisted under `process/discussions/chapter_{n}_text_discussion.md`.

4. **Scanner Agent (Archivist)**
   * **Input:** The generated Chapter Text.
   * **Action:** Analyzes the text to extract new facts.
   * **Output:** **Structured JSON** containing:
     * `new_characters` / `updated_characters`
     * `new_rules` (World building updates)
     * `relationships` (Character dynamics)
     * `events` (Timeline additions)
     * `details` (Semantic chunks for Vector Store)
   * **Validation Gate:**
     * Payload must pass schema checks before review.
     * Invalid payloads are persisted for debugging and rejected from commit.

4b. **Critic Fact Review (Pre-Commit)**

* **Input:** Validated Scanner JSON + current DB state snapshot + chapter text.
* **Action:** LLM Critic examines all extracted facts against established story state in a single batch call.
* **Detection Scope:** Dead→alive contradictions, strict world rule violations, logical/causal impossibilities, character identity contradictions.
* **Output:** Issues list with severity levels:
  * `BLOCKING` — fact removed from payload; conflict queued for manual review.
  * `NON_BLOCKING` — fact kept in payload; conflict queued as advisory.
* **Fallback:** If the Critic LLM call fails, facts pass through unchanged (graceful degradation).

5. **Memory Manager (System)**
   * **Action:** Parses the Scanner's JSON.
   * **Updates:**
     * **SQLite:** Inserts/Updates rows in `characters` and `timeline`.
     * **FAISS:** Embeds semantic details and adds them to the vector index.
   * **Audit Layer (New):**
     * Writes row-level revisions into `fact_revisions`.
     * Records chapter batch state in `chapter_commits`.
     * Queues unresolved hard contradictions in `conflict_queue`.

6. **Loop**
   * The next Planner iteration queries the updated database, ensuring the story reacts to previous events (e.g., if a character died in Chapter 1, the Planner for Chapter 2 knows they are dead).
   * Chapter summaries are persisted in `chapter_{n}_facts_summary.md` and reused when resuming auto mode from later chapters.
   * Auto mode is interruption-resumable by artifact detection:
     * Runtime artifacts under `novel/` are validated before resume (`.json`, `.jsonl`, markdown/text files, and chapter commit linkage).
     * `chapter_{n}_facts.json` must remain valid JSON and pass schema checks.
     * `discussion_index.jsonl` is line-validated as JSONL.
     * A chapter is considered complete only when chapter text, facts summary, facts JSON, and latest `scan_chapter` commit payload/status are all valid.
     * If any check fails, chapter-scoped artifacts are discarded and the chapter is regenerated from planning.

## Conflict Visibility in Planning

Planner context now includes a compact list of pending conflicts (`conflict_queue`) so generated contracts can avoid compounding unresolved contradictions.

## Retrieval Pipeline (Intent -> SQLite -> FAISS -> Alignment)

Planning/writing retrieval now follows an explicit chain:

1. Query intent classification (`task_type`, strictness, required tiers, semantic gate).
2. SQLite prefilter (characters/rules/events/conflicts by intent scope).
3. FAISS semantic retrieval (Tier-3 candidates).
4. Cross-tier alignment:
   * **Future Gate Filter**: Strictly filters out any semantic hits whose metadata indicates they are from future chapters (`metadata["chapter"] > current_chapter_num`), preventing narrative foresight leaks.
   * **Dead Characters Filter**: In strict mode, filters out semantic hits mentioning dead characters. In non-strict mode, all hits pass through.
5. Context package assembly for prompts (policy + compact summaries + aligned Tier-3 details).

## Conflict Detection Architecture

Conflict detection uses a **two-layer approach**:

### Layer 1: Deterministic Checks (memory.py)

Performed at the data layer during insertion:

* `status_dead_to_alive` — character resurrection → `BLOCKING`
* `identity_field_conflict` — immutable field change → `BLOCKING`
* `timeline_dead_character_involved` — event references dead character → `NON_BLOCKING` (flagged for Critic review)
* `relationship_type_change` — type mismatch → `NON_BLOCKING`
* `relationship_dead_character_involved` → `NON_BLOCKING`
* `timeline_same_key_conflict` — duplicate event key → `BLOCKING`
* Exact deduplication (rules and events)

### Layer 2: LLM Critic Review (workflow.py)

Performed before DB commit in `scan_chapter()` via `_critic_review_extracted_facts()`:

* Reviews all extracted facts against current DB state in a single batch LLM call.
* Detects semantic/logical contradictions that keyword matching cannot: causal impossibilities, strict world rule violations, character identity conflicts.
* `BLOCKING` issues → facts removed from payload, conflicts queued.
* `NON_BLOCKING` issues → facts kept, conflicts queued as advisory.

## Conflict Levels (Blocking vs Non-Blocking)

* `conflict_queue` stores `blocking_level` (`BLOCKING` or `NON_BLOCKING`).
* `conflict_queue` also stores triage metadata: `priority` and `suggested_action`.
* Workflow gating behavior is controlled by `BLOCKING_CONFLICT_MODE`:
  * `auto_keep_existing`: auto-resolve `BLOCKING` conflicts with `keep_existing` before gate checks.
  * `manual_block`: never auto-resolve; gate blocks while any `BLOCKING` conflict remains.

### Multi-Agent Cooperative Debate Conflict Resolver

When running under continuous writing mode (`--auto`) or enabled via the CLI flag (`--ai-resolve-conflicts`), the system automatically spawns a specialized **Cooperative Discussion Panel** consisting of three AI agents to debate and resolve any encountered blocking conflicts:

* **Critic (Historian)**: Strict defender of database integrity, rules, and past continuity (advocates for `keep_existing`).
* **Scanner (Prose Advocate)**: Defends new creative prose intentions, momentum, and character developments (advocates for `apply_incoming`).
* **Planner (Arbitrator)**: Leads the discussion panel, moderates the debate, and synthesizes a final narrative consensus or creative compromise.

#### Debate Termination & Standoff Governance (Fail-Fast)

* **Consensus Rule**: The debate runs for exactly $N$ rounds (configured via `conflict_discussion_rounds`, default: 2).
* **Fail-Fast Boundary**: If the Planner cannot synthesize a unanimous agreement on exactly `"apply_incoming"` or `"keep_existing"` by the final round, **the system must immediately stop and trigger a standoff** (raising `RuntimeError`). This prevents silent data corruption and queues the debate log for human inspection.
* **Deep Context Assembly**: The debate panel receives a comprehensive context window including:
  * **Multi-Chapter Prose Window**: Full text of preceding chapter Ch N-1, conflict chapter Ch N, and succeeding chapter Ch N+1.
  * **Structured Context**: SQLite character profiles/attributes, global strict world rules, and the last 10 timeline events.
* **Auditable Logs**: Every debate session transcript and reasoning is written to `novel/process/discussions/conflict_{id}_resolution_discussion.md`.

## High-Level AI Autonomy & Dynamic Subagent Delegation

To support complex narrative tasks, background lore alignment, and timeline auditing, the system implements an experimental **Modular Broker-Node Autonomy Suite** that empowers AI agents to transition from passive context consumers to active coordinators.

### 1. Modular Event-Broker Node Architecture

The autonomy suite is built on a highly decoupled event-driven model:

* **`AgentNode`**: Represents a single agent in the execution tree. Prepend runtime identity profile headers to prompt templates (identity, parent node, sibling peers, spawning boundaries, active objective) to maintain role discipline. Executes tasks inside a bounded ReAct (Reasoning & Action) tool invocation loop.
* **`MessageBroker`**: Coordinates and routes message transfers between parent, child, and sibling agents. Handles message registration and supports P2P collaborative queues between sibling specialist teams.
* **`GatedFileReader`**: Protects the LLM context window from massive logs or data dumps by restricting direct reads on files exceeding `large_file_threshold_kb` (default: 50 KB). Returns a structured **File Outline** warning (with sampled lines) instead, forcing agents to query specific slices using the paginated `read_file_chunk(path, start_line, end_line)` tool (capped at `max_chunk_lines` e.g. 100). Includes `read_file_tail` for streaming logs and index files.
* **`SupervisorAgent`**: An asynchronous, non-participating observer auditor node subscribed to all broker traffic. It does not write prose or argue details. Instead, it enforces constraints:
  * **Resource Cost Budgeting**: Tracks estimated session tokens and terminates execution with an `EARLY_TERMINATION` command if costs exceed the configured cap (default: `$1.00`).
  * **Deadlock Detection**: Analyzes debate logs across a sliding 3-turn window using a word-overlap lexical similarity metric (> 75%). If sibling agents fall into circular arguments, it interjects an `INTERJECT_PROMPT` command containing overriding instructions to force the Planner to synthesize a compromise.
  * **Team Pruning**: Dispatches `PRUNE_NODE` commands to gracefully shut down redundant subagents upon task completion, releasing memory and active database connections.

### 2. Hierarchical Spawning & Escalation Channels

* **Depth Limit Gate**: Spawning of subagent trees is strictly restricted to a maximum depth of 2 (Root Depth 0 -> Child Depth 1 -> Grandchild Depth 2).
* **Bidirectional Escalation**: If a Grandchild agent (Depth 2) requires additional delegation or research, it is structurally forbidden from spawning depth-3 agents. Instead, it escalates a structured JSON request to its parent Child (Depth 1) node via the broker. The parent proxy coordinates the task and relays the results back down, preventing infinite agent loops and resource blowout.

### 3. Autonomy Toggles in Configuration

The entire autonomy framework is highly modular and can be fully enabled/disabled or tuned in `config.yaml` under `autonomy:`:

* `enable_autonomy_suite`: Master toggle to load/skip all autonomy components.
* `enable_autonomous_queries`: Toggle for ReAct tool use (SQLite, FAISS, Gated file paginators).
* `enable_dynamic_delegation`: Toggle for hierarchical subagent tree spawning.
* `enable_budget_monitoring`: Toggle for Supervisor Agent budget tracking.

## Commit Replay Recovery

* `chapter_commits` now tracks `error_message`, `replay_count`, and `last_replayed_at`.
* Failed scan commits can be replayed from persisted `payload_json` through CLI (`--replay-commit`).
* Replay runs the same DB mutation path (`apply_fact_payload`) under a fresh transaction and promotes commit status back to `COMPLETED` on success.
* FAISS can be deterministically rebuilt from `vector_metadata` (`--rebuild-vectors`) to recover DB/vector alignment.

## Initialization Seeding

After World Bible + Plot discussions finish, the system asks the Scanner role to extract initial structured facts (JSON schema identical to chapter scanning) and seeds SQLite/FAISS before Chapter 1 planning. This reduces empty-context starts and improves early chapter continuity.

## System Robustness & Integrity

The system employs several layers of engineering to maintain stability and consistency during long-form generation.

### 1. Multi-tier Retrieval Funnel

To avoid "context pollution," the `StoryStateManager` filters and ranks facts:

* **Intent-based Gating**: Determines if semantic retrieval is needed.
* **SQLite Pre-filtering**: Limits character and event scope based on focus entities.
* **Cross-Tier Alignment**:
  * **Spatiotemporal Future Gate**: Discards any retrieved details that belong to future chapters to prevent timeline leaks.
  * **Dead Character Gate**: Filters out semantic hallucinations (T3) that contradict hard facts (T1/T2), such as a dead character performing active actions.
* **Weighted Reranking**: Boosts details that match focus entities (+0.35) or locations (+0.50), and adds a **Temporal Proximity Boost** ($+0.4 / (1.0 + |DetailChapter - TargetChapter|)$) for active chapter details to prioritize chronologically closer events. Initial seed facts/lore are kept stable without decay.

### 2. Atomic Memory Transactions

`MemoryManager` ensures that a single bad scan doesn't corrupt the long-term memory:

* **FAISS Index Cloning**: At the start of a chapter commit, the system creates a full snapshot of the vector index.
* **Synchronized Rollback**: If a `BLOCKING` conflict occurs, the system rollbacks the SQLite transaction and restores the FAISS index from the snapshot.

### 3. Exhaustive Interruption Recovery

The `WorkflowResumeMixin` performs a three-stage integrity check during resume:

1. **Physical**: Validates file existence and non-zero size.
2. **Schema**: Validates JSON/JSONL against required schemas.
3. **Database**: Validates that the chapter commit status is marked as `COMPLETED` in the SQLite `chapter_commits` table.
*Any failure triggers a clean purge of all partial chapter artifacts.*

### 4. Language Guard

Ensures output consistency through a multi-step process with robust retry boundaries:

1. **Name Exclusion**: Known character names from the DB are excluded from text before computing CJK/Latin ratios, preventing false positives when Chinese names appear in English text (or vice versa).
2. **Confidence Ratio**: Calculates CJK/Latin character ratio on the name-excluded text.
3. **Threshold Check**: Uses direct thresholds (Chinese ≥ 20% CJK; English ≥ 60% Latin with ≤ 10% CJK) to determine if text is in the expected language.
4. **Safety Net**: For English mode, only triggers rewrite if CJK content exceeds 30% after name exclusion.
5. **Bounded LLM Rewrite Loop**: If the language check fails, the system executes an automatic LLM-driven rewrite loop. The maximum number of attempts is fully configurable via `language_rewrite_max_attempts` inside `config.yaml` (default: 2):
   * The first attempt uses a standard translation/rewrite instruction prompt.
   * Any subsequent attempts (up to the configured limit) use a highly strict **escalation prompt** explicitly demanding the pure expected language and the elimination of foreign mixed characters.
   * If all attempts fail to meet the confidence thresholds, the system raises a `RuntimeError` (fail-fast boundary) to prevent corrupted text from entering the draft.
6. **Critic Review**: Language consistency is also part of the Critic's system prompt responsibilities.

## Customization

### Model Configuration

Agent roles are completely decoupled from model specifications:

* **`config.yaml`**: Assigns agent roles (`architect_model`, `planner_model`, `writer_model`, `critic_model`, `scanner_model`, `embedding_model`, and `default_model`) to named model registration keys. Any missing or empty role assignment triggers a validation error immediately.
* **`config/ai_model_config.yaml`**: Registers credentials, providers, endpoints, and identifiers for LLM and embedding models under named keys. Unset API keys are left blank and do not trigger automatic defaults. Missing `model_name` attributes automatically fall back to the YAML key.

### i18n & Prompts

All system prompts and user-facing strings are managed in the `i18n/` directory:

* **AI Fragments & Templates**: `i18n/AI/{language_code}/`
  * `fragments.json`: Short instructions and labels used in Context.
  * `templates.md`: Multi-line system prompts and task instructions (organized by `## Key`).
* **User Messages**: `i18n/messages/{language_code}/ui.json` (UI strings, summaries, and reports).

You can add new languages or modify behavior by creating/editing files in these directories and updating `config.LANGUAGE`.
