# Todo

This document only contains In Progress, Known Issues, and Future Plans.

Any resolved issues should not be stored in this document.

## In Progress

1. Add bulk replay for failed commits (dry-run preview, per-commit report, retry policy).
2. Add end-to-end integration tests for write loop + conflict lifecycle + replay recovery + retrieval chain.
3. Tune query-intent classifier and cross-tier alignment thresholds using realistic chapter corpora.
4. Build consumers for `discussion_index.jsonl` and conflict triage output (analytics/audit dashboards).
5. Harden auto-mode resume with persistent run checkpoints and retry/backoff metadata (current version already performs strict runtime artifact integrity validation and discard/regenerate).
6. Add chapter-scope cleanup manifest so interrupted generations can purge generated artifacts and commit traces with stronger determinism.
7. Continue module split of monolithic orchestration/storage files (`workflow.py`, `memory.py`) into stable component layers (Phase 1 & 2 fully done: workflow split into resume/io/language and project/planning/writing/scanning mixins; utility helpers extracted from memory; state manager decoupled via dependency injection).
8. Harden FAISS reliability paths: batch-safe vector reset persistence, index-load failure metadata reconciliation, and rebuild skipped-row audit retention.

## Known Issues

1. FAISS rollback still depends on in-memory index cloning; for very large indices this may be memory-heavy.
2. Conflict diagnostics now include diff paths and reason labels, but root-cause graphing is still basic.
3. Language guard now has confidence scoring (and excludes known character names), but still uses rewrite fallback as the final correction path.

## Future Plans

1. Add schema-migration preflight backup/verification command before major version bumps.
2. Add explicit language-ID scoring model before rewrite fallback.
3. Introduce weighted ontology-assisted contradiction scoring for multilingual rules/events.
